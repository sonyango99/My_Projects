# Snake game
This is a python project started with a guide on how to make a game of snake on python.
Through this I learnt how to use pygame and was able to make a basic version of snake
To improve on the game I added a version of the game that have no walls as well as difficulty settings that control the snakes speed

# Fighting game
This is a python project was inspired by a task I was given while learning how to code in python to create a fight between 2 gladiators, which would be randomised to find a winner.
However feeling that I could improve upon the concept I created an interactive version in which you pick a character class and name for your character.
This was then further expanded on to create a version that allowed your characters to have special attacks.
This was the journey that led me to my final version of the game in which I used Pygame to create an interactive version of the fighting with a visual display.
